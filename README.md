# SIMPLE-WEB-CALCULATOR  
The project consists of a simple calculator that allows users to input numbers and operators, evaluate expressions, and clear the display.  
The state of the calculation is persisted using localStorage, so the calculation remains even if the page is refreshed.  
The combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provides a functional and interactive user interface.  
### Calculator Functionality:
- Arithmetic Operations: Users can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- User Interaction: Includes buttons for digits, operators, and other functions (like clear) that mimic the functionality of a physical calculator.  
- Dynamic Updates: The display updates in real-time as users input numbers and operations, providing immediate feedback.
